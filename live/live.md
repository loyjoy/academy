3. <b>If no agent is available choose</b> 
<br>a) Exit - returns to chatflow and goes into the next process</br> 
<br>b) Jump - choose where you want to send your customer if no agent is available</br> 
<br>c) Asynchronous response - Give your customer the option to get contacted via mail</br> 

4. Set <b>Waiting time in seconds for agents to respond</b> 
<br>a) Allows you to edit the time that the agents have to respond</br> 


## How to use the Live Chat as agent
Once the user enters the "Live Chat" process module, the agents receives a message in their Live section and can reply. Agents can use animations and lead the user to a certain experience or sub-process if needed. Important: Agents must go live and mark themselves as online to interact with users online.
