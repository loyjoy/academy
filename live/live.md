3. <b>If no agent is available choose</b> 
<br>a) Exit - returns to chatflow and goes into the next process</br> 
<br>b) Jump - choose where you want to send your customer if no agent is available</br> 
<br>c) Asynchronous response - Give your customer the option to get contacted via mail</br> 

4. Set <b>Waiting time in seconds for agents to respond</b> 
<br>a) Allows you to edit the time that the agents have to respond</br> 


## How to use the Live chat as agent
Once the user enters the "Live chat" process module, the agents receive a message in their Live section and can reply. Agents can use animations and lead the user to a certain experience or sub-process if needed. Important: Agents must go live and mark themselves as online to interact with users.


1. Go to the Live tab in the LoyJoy Cloud

## How to use the Live chat as user
Once customers enter the live chat, the conversation is marked as "waiting" in the live section and an agent can take over the chat. When the live chat starts and the agent is writing you also see a typing indicator which might look like this:
