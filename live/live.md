3. <b>If no agent is available choose</b> 
<br>a) Exit - returns to chatflow and goes into the next process</br> 
<br>b) Jump - decide where you want to send your customer if no agent is available</br> 
<br>c) Asynchronous response - Give your customer the option to get contacted via mail</br> 

4. Set <b>Waiting time in seconds for agents to respond</b> 
<br>a) Allows you to edit the time agents have to respond</br> 


## How to use the Live chat as an agent
As soon as the user enters the "Live chat" process module, the agents receive a message in their Live section and can reply. Agents can use animations and lead the user to a certain experience or sub-process if needed. Important: Agents must go live and mark themselves as online to interact with users.


1. Go to the Live tab in the LoyJoy Cloud

## How to use the Live chat as a user
Once customers enter the live chat, the conversation is marked as "waiting" in the live section and an agent can take over the chat. When the live chat starts and the agent is writing you also see a typing indicator which might look like this:

If no agent is available, users can leave a message and mail address:

## How to unlock the full potential of the Live chat
The Live chat module has even more to offer for your customers! You can easily redirect them to another chat experience, sub processes or show them our awesome animations live in the chat. Read on to get the full benefits!

**1. Understanding the toolbar**
<br>You've seen this image before on how to end the chat. Now we want to dive deeper and see what's behind the three icons.</br>

![Jump to](jump_to.png "Jump to")

<b>Jump to experience</b>
<br>Redirect a customer to any experience you have already created in your tenant. </br>
<b>Jump to sub process</b>
<br>Redirect the customer to another point of the experience. Useful to show how certain modules work.</br>

<br>**Example: Jump to NPS experience**</br>
Let's say a customer wants to see the NPS module in real-time. Just redirect them to any NPS experience you already created in your tenant. As soon as you've clicked on Jump to experience and chosen the relevant experience, the Live chat ends and the customer gets routed to the chosen experience.
