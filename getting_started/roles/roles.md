# Invite colleagues & assign roles

Find out how to add colleagues to your LoyJoy tenant, assign roles and manage their user accounts.

To invite your colleagues to join, start in the backend and click on the **Invite teammates** ðŸ‘‹ tab in the upper left corner beneath your tenant. You will be redirected to your settings where you will find your current user accounts. 

## User accounts

Here you have an overview of the existing user accounts for this tenant. Scroll down to add new users (if you are assigned to the 'Owner' role), for example if you want to invite a colleague. To do this, you just need to enter email address, name and role of the new user.


### Roles
There are four different roles: Owner, Editor, Support and Viewer.

1. The role _Owner_ has the most rights as everything within the platform will be available to the Owner. Only the Owner can add and manage new user accounts. Therefore, it is advisable that only a few people in your project have this role.

2. The role _Editor_ can modify and build chatbots, but has only limited insights into customer data and is not able to see explicit customer data or download CSV-Exports.

3. The role _Support_, on the other hand, can solely see customer data, but cannot work on the chat bots.

4. The role _Viewer_ can only view analytics data and has the least rights. This could be assigned to a manager who just wants to see how the chatbots are performing.
