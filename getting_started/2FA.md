2-factor authentication

At LoyJoy we always look for ways to improve the security of accounts and data. We adopted new technology to get rid of passwords.
For the best possible protection of your customer data we are adapting our login system. Passwords are not only often forgotten, but the same passwords are used for many accounts and are therefore insecure.
