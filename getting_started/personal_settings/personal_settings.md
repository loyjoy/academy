# Personal Settings  

To access your personal settings, go to *Manage* in the upper left corner beneath your tenant name. You will find the following options. 

## Tenant
Here you can set a name for your tenant. In case you are working on multiple teams, this will help you organizing your tenants and jump right into the right one. Be aware that any changes affect the whole team. 

Furthermore, you can delete your tenant and all customer data here. <br>**Caution:** This action is irreversible!</br>

## API
LoyJoy offers an API for executing processes programmatically and accessing variables. For the API an access token is required which can be generated in this view.

## Template subscriptions 
Here you have the following possibilities to view and manage your template subscriptions. 

### Tenants you have subscribed to 
View all the tenants you have currently subscribed to and who they were issued by. You can also subscribe to new tenants by adding the tenants subscription token into the box. 

### Create subscription
Under create subscription you are able to generate a new subscription token for others to subscribe to the templates you have marked as such. 
	
#### How to create a template
To create a template and add it to your token, create a new experience or go the experience you want to use. Next to the experience name, go to settings and check *"Is template"* for this experience. This experience has now been added to your templates that others can use by entering **your** subscription token into **their** tenant. 

#### Find other templates 
Create an experience from a template (selection in the dropdown under new experience: from template). Here you will be redirected to our template store. We will have many new designs and template inspirations - be sure to check them out.

## Billing 
View your current billing information under this tab. You can see the state of your subscription and your current payment period. 

### Subscription Plans 
According to your subscription plans you might have some restricted access to some of the LoyJoy features. Live Chat and NLU for example is only available to customers with the pro subscription. Certain process modules inside the process editor are also exclusive to particular subscriptions. 

### End of your Subscription 
Two weeks before your payment period ends you will get notified in your LoyJoy tenant. If your payment period ends and you have not extended your status, you will not be able to make changes inside the LoyJoy platform anymore. But donâ€™t worry! You will still be able to enter your tenant and no experiences or data will be deleted. Additionally, all currently live experiences will not be deactivated. 

## Manager Log 
Here you can find all LoyJoy user activities like logins and newly added users. You can monitor who is accessing your tenant. In addition, you can also find the logins of the users. All data is stored with timestamps and a unique ID and cannot be edited. This gives you the maximum transparency.
