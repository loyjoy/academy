# Two-factor authentication

## What is 2FA?
2FA (Two-factor authentication) is an additional protection that ensures the security of online accounts beyond the username and password.
At LoyJoy we always look for ways to improve the security of accounts and data. We adopted new technology to get rid of passwords which are not only often forgotten, but the same credentials are often used for many accounts and are therefore insecure.

## 2FA in LoyJoy?
You can log in to LoyJoy using:

1. a magic link, which is sent to your mail address and is valid for 10 minutes
