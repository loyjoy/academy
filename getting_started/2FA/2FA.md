# 2-factor authentication

At LoyJoy we always look for ways to improve the security of accounts and data. We adopted new technology to get rid of passwords which are not only often forgotten, but the same credentials are often used for many accounts and are therefore insecure.

There are several ways to log in to LoyJoy:

1. via a magic link, which is sent to the user's email address for login and is valid for 10 minutes 
2. by hardware key in accordance with the FIDO2 standard (strongly recommended)
3. Fingerprint sensor of your laptop
4. Android device via QR code
