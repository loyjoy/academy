The time for sending the code can generally be chosen by the editor. However, sending the code directly at the first registration is bad for conversion. Our standard is therefore the second registration. In detail, this means:
1. If the customer logs in for the first time with their email address, this is stored as a cookie in the browser. 
2. If both the end device and the browser remain the same, neither the email address nor a code need to be entered a second time. 
3. If the customer logs in for the first time with a new browser or device, a new code is sent.
