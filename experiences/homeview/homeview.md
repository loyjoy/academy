![Homeview](Homeviews.png "Homeview")

Before entering any widgets, letâ€™s start by assembling the body of your home view. First, choose how compact you would like your header as it influences your ability to enter a title or text at the beginning. 

![Body](body_one.png "Body")
![Body](body_two.png "Body")

You can further alter your header text and background color, as well as the background of the body. 

Now you can add some fun widgets to fill your Home View!

*p.s. Find some fun alterations for your widgets explained under the group widget!*

To do so, click the plus of the widget of your choice.

Through stories, you can create exciting insights for your customers. Provide enjoyable content by adding small video sequences in the form of stories to your Home View.

Back in the LoyJoy backend, you can add an avatar image and a logo. You are also able to enter tags for specific Storys that can help you later.

If you only want to display certain Stories, just choose the Tags you gave your Stories!

Let your customer jump directly into one of your experiences by calling to action and linking an experience to your story.

### Groups widget

Use the groups widget to place your experiences directly into your Home View and make them easily accessible for your users.

Before you enter your experiences, select the settings button on the right to find additional ways to personalise the widget. You can find the settings on any widget you enter into your Home View.

You can enter a title, alter the colours and layout. Furthermore, you can decide if the widget should be styled as a card. See below what the card style looks like in your Home View. 

![Group card](card_yes.png "Group card")

To select which experience groups to display in the Home View just active the button of each experience group. Add an image and avatar image to each experience of your Home View and choose a title and a slogan.

![Add Group widget](Add_Group.png "Add Group widget")

If you wish to add multiple groups into your Homeview use an individual Group Widget for each one.

Design your individual Group Widgets to your liking!

Let your customers go back to previous conversations just like they would do while chatting with a friend.

### Search widget 

In the search widget your customers can search through LoyJoy experiences and jump right into them.

### Web component widget 

Here you are able to integrate a Web component for your customers. "Web Components are a set of features that provide a standard component model for the Web allowing for encapsulation and interoperability of individual HTML elements." [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Components)

For example the following Web component defines a Web component with the tag `hello-world`. To integrate the Web component in LoyJoy, (1) deploy the following JavaScript snippet as a file to a Web hosting of your choice, (2) enter the URL to this file in LoyJoy as the URL of Web component and (3) enter `hello-world` as the HTML tag of the Web component.

```
(function () {
  class HelloWorld extends HTMLElement {
    constructor () {
      super()
      this.attachShadow({ mode: 'open' })

      /*
      * sic! firefox requires methods to be defined in constructor
      */

      this.someAttribute = () => this.attributes['foo']?.value

      this.render = () => {
        this.shadowRoot.innerHTML = `
          <div class="hello-world">
            Hello world
          </div>
        

        const helloWorld = this.shadowRoot.querySelector('.hello-world');

        helloWorld.onclick = () => {
          this.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent('hello', { detail: { foo: this.someAttribute } }))
        }
      }
    }

    connectedCallback() {
      if (!this._rendered) {
        this.render()
        this._rendered = true
      }
    }
  }

  if (!customElements.get('hello-world')) {
    customElements.define('hello-world', HelloWorld)
  }
})()
```
