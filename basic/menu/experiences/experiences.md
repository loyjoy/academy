# Experiences 
Start your journey with LoyJoy and build your first Experience! üéâ

## Create new Experience
Create a new Experience in the upper right corner on the orange button. You can choose between three options: start with a blank Experience and make your own from scratch, choose a template from our template store or a colleagues templates ([find our more here](https://github.com/loyjoy/academy/blob/main/basic/start/personal_settings.md)), or enter a copy token from another Experience. After you have created your Experience, it will appear in your overview under *Experiences*.

### Manage 
To manage your Experiences you can click on the three dots in the right upper corner of any Experience. Here you are able to download or upload as a file, move the Experience into a folder, copy, pause, archive or delete your Experience. 

### Archive 
You are able to archive **Experiences** (not folders) which will only be partially visible to provide you with a better structure. To archive an Experience click on the three dots on the Experience while you are still in the Folder. If you later want to restore an Experience from the archive switch on the *‚Äúarchive‚Äú* button in the overview of your Experiences and select unarchive on the specific Experience.

### Experience Settings 
For the Experience settings click on the experience and find the settings image ‚öôÔ∏è next to the name of your Experience. Enter tags, lock the process oder select the Experience as a template under this button. 

## Folders 
Structure your Experiences in different Folders for an organized overview of all your LoyJoy brand Experiences.

### Create new Folder 
You can create a new Folder by clicking on the button in the upper right corner. Choose between a blank Folder or a Folder from a token. To create a Folder from token, copy the Folder token under the three dots and insert the token. If you copy a Folder, all experiences inside the Folder will be copied and transferred. 

# Home View
The Home View is a way to make multiple experiences selectable in a single view. It only functions as a start page to visually display individual experiences in an overview.¬† The branding of the Home View is generally independent of the Experiences and is no longer inherited.

## Create new Home View 
You can find all your Home Views in the backend right next to your Experiences. To create a new Home view either start a blank Home View from the beginning or enter your token to copy an existing Home View on the orange button in the upper right corner.
