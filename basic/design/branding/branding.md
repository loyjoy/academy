# How to Adjust the Branding

Let's brand your chatbot to your preferences together. Give your chatbot a name and attract customers with a slogan. Add a placeholder for the open text field, if you wish so.

Then you can add the logo to your brand. It will appear in the upper right corner of the header of your chatbot.

You can also choose the main colour for your chatbot matching the brand's style.

An email address must be set to address customer inquiries.

Before a chatbot goes live, an imprint must be set.

If you are sending emails through your mail domain, please fill out the following fields. Ask your LoyJoy Success Manager for assistance.

Some consumers will type something into the open text field at the bottom of the chatbot. To respond to customer input, we provide standard intents to respond empathically to customer inquiries. However, in some cases, our AI algorithm will not identify the input. Define a message to send out to your customers in that case or let them fill out a contact form so that the inquiry can be addressed personally.

You can set fixed buttons in your chatbot to offer your customers the option to jump right into a certain action by using our persistent quick replies.
