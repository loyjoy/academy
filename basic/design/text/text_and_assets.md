# Texts Overview

Manage your Texts in one place -  On the Text tab, all text fields are available in aggregated form. Double-check your wording or have a copywriter edit right on the platform. You can search for individual texts and distinguish between customised or standardised texts. 

Under the Texts tab you are also able to download the CSV export of your Texts.
