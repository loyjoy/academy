# Integrate data from your LoyJoy chat into your tracking solution

With a LoyJoy chat on your site you can connect with your customers in a great way. You can watch how your customers use the chat in the LoyJoy backend. You can also extract a lot of data from LoyJoy and integrate it directly into your own website tracking solution to collect all analytics data in one place.

## Connect LoyJoy in JavaScript to Google Tag Manager

The tracking integration is based on the LoyJoy JavaScript API. Using the following code to integrate a LoyJoy chat in your site, LoyJoy events can be pushed to an existing Google Tag Manager data layer:

```
<script>
LoyJoy('boot', {
  eventListeners: [function (evt, obj) {
    dataLayer && dataLayer.push({ 'evt': evt, 'process_id': obj && obj.process_id, 'process_name': obj && obj.process_name })  
  }],
  process: OPTIONAL_PROCESS_ID,
  serviceWorkerPath: OPTIONAL_SERVICE_WORKER_PATH,
  tenant: OPTIONAL_TENANT_ID
})
</script>
```


## Events

Through the JavaScript API, following events are triggered for various events in the chat:


| Event name          | Event description |
