## TABS

### [Branding](/basic/design/branding/branding.md)<br>

Use our Branding options to design you chat UI and create powerful experiences. Give your chatbot a name and attract customers with a custom slogan or design. You can transfer brandings from one experience to another or create new ones for every individual experience.


### [Languages](/basic/design/language/language.md)<br>

Our chatbots run globally. However, you will launch your chatbot in a market with a specific language. To still benefit from chatbots in a different language, you can use our built-in translator. Choose the "Language" tab and then select your language. Scroll down to translate your chatbot from the existing language to yours.

### [Textes](/basic/design/text/text_and_assets.md)<br>

Find an overview of all used images and videos. Make sure to compress your assets to create the best customer experience!

### [Publish](/basic/design/publish/publish.md)<br>

Before you go live with your chatbot, make sure you test it and of course, share it with your colleagues. To do so, you will find three options on how to securely test your chatbot and grant feedback.
