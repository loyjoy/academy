# NLU
 With the help of AI-based Natural Language Processing (NLU), your bot can automatically respond to customer questions. Here you can train your own artificial intelligence and teach your bot new skills. Use cases and examples will be explained in more detail in the advanced course.
# Push
A notification is a message that appears on the user's device. Notifications can be triggered locally by an open application, or they can be "pushed" from the server to the user even when the application is not running. This allows users to opt-in for timely updates, and lets you effectively retarget users with custom content. Use Push Notifications to bring your consumers back into the chatbot!
# Live
Support your automated chat experiences with human expertise. Always-on agents required? Not with LoyJoy. The Live Chat feature will only be presented when your agents are available.
