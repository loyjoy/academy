# One-time-pin vs. NL-Anmeldung ohne Profil

As we do not have a members' club like "myNIVEA" at Eucerin, but only the simple newsletter registration, a normal SOI process in the bot is sufficient. You will then receive a DOI email in which you have to confirm the registration via a link.
With this procedure, we can directly request profile data (address, gender, birthday, etc.) and "care profile data" (skin condition, acne, hair types, etc.) from new subscribers who register in the bot and transfer them to SFSC. Of course, this data can only be used after confirmation of the DOI email.

The One-Time-Pin (which NIVEA must use) works in such a way that users are authenticated by entering the code (which they receive by email). We can then access their complete FSO profile directly in the chatbot and read out existing data and address the users by their first name, for example. Furthermore, we can then write the missing data into both existing and newly registered profiles and use it directly for everything, because the one-time pin authentication already counts as a DOI. No need to confirm an email or anything like that here.

The bottom line is that with the one-time pin, one has many more possibilities to use the interface because one can read and write data, both in existing and new profiles, and no DOI email is necessary.
