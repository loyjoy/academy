### What is a NLU model?
NLU stands for Natural Language Understanding. Your chat experience can have a free text input field where users can enter their questions. The NLU model is used to find out what the user wants to do (intent matching) and gives an answer you entered. The model itself learns from training data (user input examples) you provide for each of the intents.

### How are Experience and Home View related? Where are the "old bots”?
The experiences are the chat processes you already know, nothing has changed. The home view is a way to make multiple experiences selectable in a single view. It only functions as a start page to visually display individual experiences in an overview.  The branding of the home view is generally independent of the experiences and is no longer inherited.

### What are Referrer, Website and User Agent (Live Area)?
In the live chat, you can expand a field on the right side that contains information about the current customer. The "Referrer" is the page the customer was on before the live chat, under "Website" you can see which page the customer is currently on and the "User Agent" indicates the browser the customer is using. 

### Where is the old "Manage Tab" for managing my raffles and giveaways?
On the left, there is your navigation bar, where you need to open the menu point called "data". All data is stored in categories that you can access via the tabs there. Here you can already see the categories "Giveaways" and "Instant Win". In the dropdown menu, you can select the experience where you collected the participants. The further procedure of random selection has remained the same. 

### What can be found in all the tabs in the data area? (Codes, variables, files, etc.)
#### All data is stored in categories that you can access via the tabs there:

+ Customers: Customer database with email addresses and customer variables

+ Consents: opt-in consent such as newsletter single opt-ins and double opt-ins

### How can I restore an experience from the archive?

### What are the daily reminders that I can activate on the Experiences?
