# What Is Artificial Intelligence?

Artificial Intelligence, short AI, is the ability of a computer system to solve problems independently of humans. This is done in an attempt to imitate human behavior in order to achieve comparable learning abilities. In this way, systems that have been trained for specific tasks can be adapted to different inputs.
