<br>NLU stands for Natural Language Understanding. With the help of AI-based NLU, your bot can automatically respond to customer questions. Here you can train your own artificial intelligence and teach your bot new skills. Your chat experiences have a free text field in which customer can type their requests and comments. With NLU, you can create so called "intents" concerning a certain topic (e.g. goodbye).</br>
