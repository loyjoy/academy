## Analytics

Once you are in the Analytics tab, you can find your aggregated, tenant-wide KPIs under _Dashboard_ at the top of the page and the performance of the individual experience in the view in the respective folders. By clicking on the chart icon, you can easily access the KPIs of **each experiece.** If you click on the bell icon, you can sign up (or unsubscribe) for a **daily report** by email on the performance of each experience. There are two tabs in this view: Overview & [Drilldown](/analytics/drill_down/drill_down.md). The Overview tab shows data such as KPIs and general charts for this experience. The _Drill-down_ tab shows the heatmap depicting which process modules were visited how often and allows you to click on each module to analyze module-specific data.
