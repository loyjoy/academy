## 2. Drill-down tab at a glance

The drilldown tab shows a sequential view of the different modules that make up an experience. For each of the modules it shows the number of times this module was shown. Laid over the the modules is a heatmap that visually indicates the relative frequency (blue over green and yellow to red from low to high).

## 3. Which numbers are displayed (Drill-down-Tab)

A color visualized heatmap shows how often each of the modules were displayed. The color gradient from blue to green to yellow to red shows a low to high 
frequency.
If you click on the individual modules, you will get more detailed information. For each module, it is indicated how often it was passed through. For some 
modules, there are also additional KPIs. These are explained in more detail [here](#51-web-push-opt-in).
