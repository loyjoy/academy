# How to measure success

Track the performance of your live chatbots, better understand your customers' behaviour and see your KPIs skyrocket by using the LoyJoy Analytics Dashboard.

You can find your aggregated, tenant-wide KPIs under "Dashboard" and the performance of the individual chat bots and experiences by clicking on the corresponding names.
Depending on your chat use case, you will find general KPIs such as the screen time, participants, and newsletter subscribers for each of your chat experiences.
