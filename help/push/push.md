# Push
Use Push Notifications to bring your consumers back into the chatbot!

You can send Push-Notifications to your customers! The main technology we use is Web-Push Technology. It is connected with your browser, so also the setting is browser-specific. The Push-Notifications are also personalizable, what you can do is to use the stored preferences (see customers) to give them specific Push Information, e.g. special Offers.
