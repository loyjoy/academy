Here you can find your customer database. Within your exciting chat experiences, you can collect customer data points and therefore create rich customer datasets. 
Each new registration (via email address) will be listed here with the according timestamp and all person-related data points collected. To access an individual dataset, simply click on the email address. 

Now you can track each consumer's actions in the chat, check their opt-in settings and access their legal consent. 

You can export the whole consumer list and individual constomers. You also have the option to purge your customer database based on certain variables.
