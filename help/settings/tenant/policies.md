# User accounts

Here you have an overview of the existing user accounts for this tenant. You can add new users (if you are assigned to the 'Owner' role), for example if you want to invite a colleague. To do this, you just need to enter email address, name and role of the new user.


## Roles
There are four different roles: Owner, Editor, Support and Viewer.

1. The role 'Owner' has the most rights. It is advisable that only a few people in your project have this role.

2. The role 'Editor' can modify and build chatbots, but has no insights into customer data.

3. The role 'Support', on the other hand, can see customer data, but cannot work on the chat bots.

4. The role with the least rights is 'Viewer', which can only view analytics. For example, this could be a manager who just wants to see how the chatbots are performing.
