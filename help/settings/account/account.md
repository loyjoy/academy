# My account 

When logging in, no password is required. Passwords are insecure and users often forget them. 
Instead, there are two ways to log in to LoyJoy:

1. Via a magic link, which is sent to the user's email address for login and is valid for 10 minutes.
2. By using a security key! This is currently the most secure login option available and is strongly recommended. Keys are available in retail for about 20 Euro and can also be used to secure e.g. Google and Facebook accounts (extended security).
The key function can also be placed on the fingerprint scanner of your laptop and is then even more convenient.

To add a USB security key or a fingerprint security key, just click on "Add security key" and follow the instructions.

At the bottom of the page you will see your personal login data, including your role in the project. If you want to add a new user, [visit 'User accounts'](https://cloud.loyjoy.com/manager/settings?tab=users).
