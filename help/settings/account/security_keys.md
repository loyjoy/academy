# Security Keys

Two-factor authentication (2FA) is an additional protection that ensures the security of online accounts beyond the username and password. LoyJoy supports 2FA based on security keys, which is the strongest form of 2FA in comparison to other solutions such as SMS-based tokens or one-time passwords (OTP).

We strongly recommend you to add a FIDO2 key to you LoyJoy user account, which can be bought as [USB + wireless NFC](https://www.mtrix.de/shop/security-key-nfc/) or [USB-only](https://www.mtrix.de/shop/security-key-fido2/). The LoyJoy team members as well as most LoyJoy customers use the [USB + wireless NFC](https://www.mtrix.de/shop/security-key-nfc/) version, which makes it easy to switch between your devices (computer, mobile phone), and can be used not only to secure your LoyJoy user account, but also all kinds of other [services](https://www.yubico.com/de/works-with-yubikey/catalog/?sort=popular) such as Google, AWS, Salesforce etc.

Simply click `Add security key` to add the security key. Afterwards your LoyJoy user account can only be opened with physical access to your security key.
