## Mini program

Add any existing web application or website into the chat. It will open within the chat window. Via API even data can be exchanged with the external application.

**URL** - Add the URL of your mini program.   
**Wording** - Choose the text of the mini program button.

Some server security settings don't allow itself to be embedded on pages other than itself. This prevents e.g. phishing sites pretending to be the website. So mini programs can only work when the chatbot is running on the actual page.
