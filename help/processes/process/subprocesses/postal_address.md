## Postal address

Ask for postal address and store it in the CRM.

The zipcode by default is allowed to have an arbitrary pattern. If you only want to allow 5-digit numbers, under `input validation` you can enter following regular expression pattern:

```
[0-9]{5}
```

**Intro** - Add an intro to introduce before asking for a postal address.    
**Other texts** - Choose placeholder for the form.   
**Sign in** - The consumer must be signed in.
