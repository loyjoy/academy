**Buttons** - If this list contains any buttons, this process module waits for user input.
You can add buttons to each element and to the whole List. The button for the whole List is located at the top next to the header "List". The "React to this answer" option can respond to the user selection with the text you entered in the input field. If you want to use the user input of the buttons, you must enter a string as a variable above. This variable will be used for all values in this module. To enable the element buttons, use the settings button on each element.

**Selection buttons** - The customers can use only one selection button as userinput.

**Style "Compact"** - this is the default and looks like this:

**Style "Large"** - This style uses the first element as the top element and displays it differently. The font color will be white, so you need to make sure you use a dark image for the first element.
