## Event

Trigger an event with the name of your choice. The event is (1) emitted via LoyJoy JavaScript API, (2) stored in the LoyJoyAnalytics database, AND (3) triggers signal process modules that wait for the event name.

You can read about all the events and their function [here](https://github.com/loyjoy/academy/blob/main/tracking_integration/google_tag_manager/google_tag_manager.md).
