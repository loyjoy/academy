## Reminder notification

Schedule a reminder notification to your customer at a certain point in time.

If the customer has given a Web push double opt-in and a reminder double opt-in before, the notification can be sent via Web push. Else if the customer has given a reminder double opt-in before, the notification can be sent via email.

For example in case of an advent calendar the chat can remind customers from 1.12. till 24.12. to open the advent calendar door.
