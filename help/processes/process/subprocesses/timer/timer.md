## Timer

Start or restart the chat at specific points in time. As soon as the timer is triggered, the customer will see a marking on the Web chat bubble and in the Web chat UI. When the customer opens the Web chat, the process flow will proceed at the timer process module.

For example in case of an advent calendar the chat would offer customers from 1.12. till 24.12. to open the advent calendar door.
