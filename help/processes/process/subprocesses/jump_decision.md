## Decision jump

Let customers decide to jump into a process step or into another chatbot experience. Choose up to seven jumps.

**Choose experience** - Jump into another chatbot experience to connect different chatbots.
**Choose sub process** - Jump to process brick in this experience.

**Jumping** - Jumping between experiences/processes does not discard any given information or local variables. The flow behaves like one experience. You can not jump into a different bot (just experiences and sub processes).

**Open new view** - If you jump between experiences, you can choose to open the new experience in a new view.
