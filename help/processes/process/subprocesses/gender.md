## Gender

Ask your customer for gender.
![gender_example_demo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/loyjoy/welcome/master/help/processes/process/subprocesses/gender_example.png)

**Storage** - If you want to store this information in association with your customer, you must have a sign-in module somewhere before the gender module. If you are not using the sign-in module, you can still use this information in the conversation by using the "gender" variable with the following syntax: ${gender}

**Value** - The value of the gender does not depend on the text you can edit. These are the values:
Gender(Female input) -> female,
Gender(Male input) -> male,
Gender(Diverse input) -> diverse.

**Other texts** - Here you can add an intro and a message which will be sent after the consumer input.

**Sign in** - The consumer must be signed in order to save this data.

**Database** - Your customer database has to be activated by LoyJoy to use all the Sign-in functions.
