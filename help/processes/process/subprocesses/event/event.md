## Event

Trigger an event with the name of your choice. The event is (1) emitted via LoyJoy [JavaScript API](/experiences/publish/javascript_api/javascript_api.md), (2) stored in the LoyJoy [Analytics database](/help/analytics/analytics.md), and (3) triggers [Signal process modules](/help/processes/process/subprocesses/signal.md) that wait for the event name.

You can read about all the events and their function [here](/experiences/events/events.md).
