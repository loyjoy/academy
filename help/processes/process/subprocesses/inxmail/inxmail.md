## Inxmail integration

Subscribe or unsubscribe customers from an Inxmail mailing list.

At a minimum, the four fields of the Inxmail have to be filled: `Customer`, `Client ID`, `API secret`, `List ID` (ID of the list you want to subscribe the customer to).

Then the mode has to be selected `Subscribe` or `Unsubscribe`. Like the name says, this will either subscribe or unsubscribe the customer in the process t o / from selected mailing list.

You can also transfer additional data using the mappings at the bottom of the module. You can transfer data e.g. stored in a variable by a questionnaire into `attributes` in Inxmail. The attribute has to be created beforehand in Inxmail.
