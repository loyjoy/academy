# Experiences
Here you find your experiences.
An experience is a single chat flow such as a Newsletter Subscription or a Giveaway use case. You can organize your experiences in folder by moving them into the desired location. You can access individual experiences by clicking on them.

### How to set up your experience

To create your own experience from scratch, click on "Create experience". Then decide whether you want to use our ready-made experiences (e.g. giveaway or advent calendar) or whether you prefer to start from scratch.   

To reuse an existing chat experience, click on the three dots of the chat experience and select "Copy experience". Then click "Create experience" and simply paste the copy token.
