# Login to LoyJoy

For security reasons, we do not provide a password for the login. Instead, the following two login options are available.

## 1. Login with Magic Link ðŸª„ (simple security)

- Visit the login page at https://cloud.loyjoy.com/users/sign_in

- Enter your e-mail address

- Within a few seconds you will receive an e-mail with the subject [LoyJoy] Sign in.

- Click on the link in the e-mail and you will automatically be logged in to your LoyJoy tenant.

We strongly recommend the use of a security key.

## 2. Login with FIDO2 Key or fingerprint reader ðŸ”‘ (highest security)

- To register a security key, first log in via Magic Link (see above).

- Click on "Settings" and then "My account" https://cloud.loyjoy.com/settings?tab=account

- Click on the button `Add security key`. You will then be prompted to add either your terminal device (e.g. fingerprint reader of your laptop) or a FIDO2 key via USB port. Confirm with your fingerprint or press the button on your FIDO2 key.

## 3. Solve login problems

- A Magic Link is valid for a **maximum of 10 minutes**. Delete outdated Magic Link emails to avoid accidentally clicking on them.

- **Only the last Magic Link you requested is valid**. As soon as you request a new link, all previous links immediately lose their validity. Pay attention to the date and time of your Magic Link e-mail.

- If your e-mail client changes the Magic Link (e.g. due to some plug-ins for Microsoft Outlook), **copy the link manually** and paste it into the browser.

- **Account lock** If you use an invalid or outdated Magic Link, you will receive an error message. If you repeatedly use an invalid or outdated Magic Link, your account will be temporarily blocked for security reasons. Wait a few minutes, the lock will end automatically. Each further unsuccessful login attempt will result in an exponential extension of the lock. It is not possible to lift the lock manually.
